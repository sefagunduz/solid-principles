# solid-principles

## The SOLID ideas are

- The single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

- The open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

- The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.

- The interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."

- The dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
